        <p>During the early 9th century the greater Chittagong area, including Cox's Bazar, was under the rule of Arakan
            kings until its conquest by the Mughals in 1666.[5] When the Mughal Prince Shah Shuja was passing through
            the hilly terrain of the present-day Cox's Bazar on his way to Arakan, he was attracted to its scenic and
            captivating beauty. He commanded his forces to camp there. His retinue of one thousand palanquins stopped
            there for some time. A place named Dulahazara, meaning "one thousand palanquins," still exists in the area.
            After the Mughals, the place came under the control of the Tipras and the Arakanese, followed by the
            Portuguese and then the British. The name Cox's Bazar originated from the name of a British East India
            Company officer, Captain Hiram Cox, who was appointed as the Superintendent of Palonki (today's Cox's Bazar)
            outpost. He succeeded Warren Hastings, who became the Governor of Bengal following the British East India
            Company Act in 1773. Cox embarked upon the task of rehabilitation and settlement of the Arakanese refugees
            in the area.[6] He rehabilitated many refugees in the area, but died in 1799 before finishing his work. To
            commemorate him, a market was established and named after him, called Cox's Bazar. Cox's Bazar was first
            established in 1854 and became a municipality in 1869.[5] After the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857, the British East
            India Company was highly criticised on humanitarian grounds, specially for its opium trade monopoly over the
            Indian Sub-Continent. However, after its dissolution on 1 January 1874, the company's assets, including its
            armed forces, were acquired by the British Crown. After this takeover, Cox's Bazar was declared a district
            of the Bengal Province under the British Crown</p>
